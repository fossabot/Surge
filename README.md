### Configure Apple Push Notifications (APN)

Ok, this is a bit of a pain. Follow carefully. 

- Go to `https://developer.apple.com/` and follow the steps to create a new certificate. Create a Push Notification certificate and download.
- Add this certificat to your keychain (double clicking should do this). 
- Navigate to Certificate and look for the certificate you just added.
- Ctrl click the certificate and click export. Enter a password.
- the run `openssl pkcs12 -in Certificates.p12 -out apns.pem -nodes -clcerts`

Then your app should be able to do the rest..


### Configure Google Push Notifications (GPN)

Google makes things easier, all you need is an API key. Go to https://console.developers.google.com/ and enable Push Notifictions.
